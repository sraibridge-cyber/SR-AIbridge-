# SR-AIbridge Deployment Verification Guide

**Date**: November 7, 2025  
**Purpose**: Verify system has exited "safe placeholder mode" and is fully operational  
**Status**: ✅ Backend verified operational, frontend configured correctly

---

## Executive Summary

The SR-AIbridge system deployment validator has been thoroughly tested and verified. **Both core systems (BRH and Healing Net) are operational**, which means the system **SHOULD exit placeholder mode** automatically when the frontend connects to the backend.

---

## Quick Verification Steps

### 1. Start the Backend (Required)

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/SR-AIbridge-/SR-AIbridge-
python -m uvicorn bridge_backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
INFO:bridge_backend.main:[BOOT] Starting SR-AIbridge Runtime
INFO:bridge_backend.bridge_core.sovereignty.readiness_gate:👑 [Sovereignty] SOVEREIGNTY ACHIEVED
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### 2. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd bridge-frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
VITE v5.4.20  ready in 276 ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

### 3. Open Browser and Check Console

1. Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
2. Open Browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab

**Look for these messages:**

✅ **OPERATIONAL (Good):**
```
[DeploymentValidator] Starting true deployment validation...
[DeploymentValidator] Validation complete: {trueDeployment: true, ...}
🎉 TRUE BRIDGE OPERATIONAL: Core systems online!
   ✅ BRH: PASS
   ✅ Healing Net: PASS
   🔓 Frontend will exit placeholder mode and reveal components
```

❌ **PLACEHOLDER MODE (Problem):**
```
🕵️ Bridge in placeholder mode: Core deployment not yet achieved
   ❌ Critical: BRH is not responding
```

---

## System Architecture

### Core Systems (REQUIRED for deployment)

1. **BRH (Bridge Runtime Handler)**: Backend health and status
   - Endpoint: `/api/health/status`
   - Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL
   - Response: `{"status": "OK", "uptime": ..., "timestamp": ...}`

2. **Healing Net**: System health monitoring
   - Endpoint: `/api/health/health`
   - Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL
   - Response: `{"status": "ok", "sovereignty": {...}, ...}`

### Optional Systems (failures don't block deployment)

3. **Crypto/Custody**: Key management system
   - Endpoint: `/custody/status`
   - Status: ⚠️ REQUIRES ADMIRAL AUTH (returns 403)
   - Note: This is **expected and OK** - crypto is optional

4. **Umbra Lattice**: Fallback and shadow operations
   - Endpoint: `/api/health/health/full`
   - Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL
   - Response: `{"status": "healthy", "components": {...}}`

5. **Indoctrination Engine**: Agent training system
   - Endpoint: `/engines/indoctrination/status`
   - Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL
   - Response: `{"status": "operational", "engine": "indoctrination", ...}`

## Test Results

### Backend Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/status
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "uptime": 2.404081689,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-07T21:25:38.760589+00:00"
}
```

### Deployment Validation Simulation

Run the comprehensive test:

```bash
python /tmp/comprehensive_deployment_test.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🎉 TRUE DEPLOYMENT ACHIEVED!
   Status: OPERATIONAL
   Mode: PRODUCTION
   
Core Systems Online: ✅ YES
Systems Online: 4/5 (80.0%)
```

## Frontend Components

### Components Wrapped with SovereignRevealGate

These components will:
- ✅ Show **placeholder UI** when backend is NOT deployed
- ✅ Show **real functionality** when backend IS deployed

1. **AgentFoundry** (`/agent-foundry`)
   - System: Indoctrination Engine
   - Purpose: Create and manage AI agents
   - Placeholder: "Component - Initializing" message
   - Real: Full agent creation form and management interface

2. **BrainConsole** (`/brain`)
   - System: Brain/Memory system
   - Purpose: Manage agent memories
   - Placeholder: "Waiting for backend systems" message
   - Real: Memory management interface

3. **VaultLogs** (`/vault-logs`)
   - System: Vault
   - Purpose: View secure logs
   - Placeholder: "Vault logs temporarily unavailable"
   - Real: Log viewer and filtering

4. **MissionLog** (`/mission-log`)
   - System: Mission system
   - Purpose: Track and manage missions
   - Placeholder: "Mission system temporarily unavailable"
   - Real: Mission list and management

5. **AdmiralKeysPanel** (`/custody`)
   - System: Custody/Keys
   - Purpose: Cryptographic key management
   - Placeholder: "Custody system temporarily unavailable"
   - Real: Key management interface (requires admiral role)

### Data Services Using TrueDataRevealer

These services automatically switch from placeholder to real data:

- **RealAgentService**: Returns actual agents or placeholder agent
- **RealVaultService**: Returns actual vault logs or empty array
- **RealMissionService**: Returns actual missions or placeholder missions
- **RealBrainService**: Returns actual brain stats or placeholder stats

## Deployment Status Badge

Located in the header of the frontend application.

### Status Indicators

| Badge          | Meaning                | Cause                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ✅ PRODUCTION  | System fully deployed  | Both core systems online       |
| ⚠️ DEGRADED    | Partial deployment     | Some optional systems offline  |
| 🛠️ DEVELOPMENT | Not deployed           | Core systems offline           |
| ❌ UNKNOWN     | Validation not run     | First load                     |

### How to Check

1. Look at top-right corner of the application
2. Click the badge to see detailed status
3. Should show: "✅ PRODUCTION - All systems operational"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Frontend shows placeholder mode despite backend running

**Possible Causes:**

1. **CORS Issue**: Frontend can't reach backend
   - Check browser console for CORS errors
   - Verify backend allows requests from frontend origin

2. **Port Mismatch**: Frontend configured for wrong port
   - Check `bridge-frontend/.env` or `vite.config.js`
   - Should be `VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000`

3. **Backend Not Fully Started**: Still initializing
   - Wait 5-10 seconds after backend starts
   - Look for "Uvicorn running" message

4. **Cache Issues**: Old validation cached
   - Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser localStorage

### Problem: Custody endpoint returns 403

**This is EXPECTED and OK!**

The custody endpoint requires admiral authentication. This is by design and doesn't prevent deployment. The deployment validator correctly handles this as an optional system failure.

### Problem: Components show "Initializing" forever

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1. Open browser console
2. Look for `[DeploymentValidator]` messages
3. Check if `trueDeployment: true` in validation results
4. If false, check which core system failed
5. Verify that core system endpoint is accessible

---

## Manual Endpoint Testing

Test each endpoint manually to verify backend is responding:

```bash
# Core System 1: BRH
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/status
# Expected: {"status": "OK", ...}

# Core System 2: Healing Net
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok", ...}

# Optional: Custody (will return 403 - this is OK)
curl http://localhost:8000/custody/status
# Expected: {"detail": "custody_admiral_only"}

# Optional: Umbra
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/health/full
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "components": {...}}

# Optional: Indoctrination
curl http://localhost:8000/engines/indoctrination/status
# Expected: {"status": "operational", ...}
```

### Expected Behavior: ✅ EXIT PLACEHOLDER MODE

Based on testing:
- Core systems are operational
- Deployment validation logic is correct
- Frontend should automatically exit placeholder mode
- Components should reveal real functionality
- Data should switch from placeholder to real

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run end-to-end test** with browser
2. **Verify deployment status badge** shows PRODUCTION
3. **Test each component** to ensure real functionality
4. **Check data fetching** returns real data (not placeholders)
5. **Document any issues** in browser console

---

## Contact & Support

If system remains in placeholder mode after following this guide:

1. Collect browser console logs
2. Collect backend logs
3. Run verification tests
4. Check network tab for failed requests
5. Verify environment configuration

---

**Status**: System architecture verified correct, deployment should succeed automatically when backend is running.

**Conclusion**: The SR-AIbridge is properly configured to exit placeholder mode. Both core systems are operational and meet all deployment requirements.
